This also depends on the length of the effect in relation to the modulation wavelength, that is nontrivial in RF. Note you then need to account for group-index and similar compatibility model parameters. The dynamic response will then be determined by further electro-thermal model parameters dependent on the papers. You then need to time and space chop the calculation of the signal as it propagates through the waveguide if you wish to get dynamic responses, and you need to take into account delays and inter-interference effects from dynamics delays when not a pure first order reponse occurs. The simulation method becomes time-stepped within space inside models, rather than time-stepped within models assuming some discrete absolute delay in that path - so may require different simulation methods - ie incompatible."
